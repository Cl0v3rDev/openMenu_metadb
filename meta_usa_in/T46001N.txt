description=Imagine, if you will, a berserk B-movie horror-film producer with a twisted sense of humor who puts up a million bucks (fictitious, of course!) to anyone who can survive his seven, movie-themed worlds. It's a bloody mess of mutant monsters, over 1000 traps and items, and abject terror fused with B-movie humor.
